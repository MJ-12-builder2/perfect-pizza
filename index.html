            Margherita is the mother of all pizzas. This Neopaltian-style pizza has thin crust, fresh tomato sauce,
            fresh mozzarella cheese, and just a few leaves of basil. Margherita’s toppings are simple but they also
            have the power to be truly sublime in a way few other toppings can be.

            Pepperoni pizza, We’d wager that pepperoni is still America’s number-one, most-popular pizza
            topping. The salty and slightly spicy taste holds its own against waves of melty, gooey cheese
            and gets ever-so-slightly crisped in the hot oven in such a crave-worthy way that no one can
            resist pulling them straight from the smoldering hot pizza and dropping them directly into their
            mouths.
